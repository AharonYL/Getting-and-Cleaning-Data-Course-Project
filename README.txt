==================================================================Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Cleaning Exercise==================================================================Built by Aharon!==================================================================After being given the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset which, to quote the authors, have been “carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.”Data was gathered using an accelerometer and a gyroscope, and several variables were calculated from this. For more information about the dataset itself, check out this link:http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+SmartphonesThis dataset is a simple transformation of the dataset linked above. For each variable, the average standard deviation and average average are taken for each subject within each activity, in addition to providing a clean version of the original dataset. The dataset includes the following files:=========================================- 'README.txt'- ‘run_analysis.R’ : the actual code used to pull in the data and make the necessary transformations- ‘CodeBook.Rmd’ : an R markdown document that explains all the variables, all the the transformations, and the all the code  from run_analysis.RNotes: ======- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
